# Flansch

A flanger effect plugin for audio processing, based on RNBO exports and built with HISE.

**Project Status:** Version 1.0.1

## Features

* Core flanger DSP logic derived from RNBO export (incorporating rnbo_guitar_pedals components).
* User interface built and scripted using HISE.
* Controllable parameters: Speed, Depth, Position, Offset, Feedback, Color, Spread, Comp, Gain, Mix.

## Feature Overview

**Flansch** is a creative, experimental flanger effect designed for flexible use in DAWs, Max for Live, and even on Raspberry Pi setups. It blends vintage flanger behavior with modern features such as sidechain compression and stereo modulation.

### Core Parameters

* **Speed**: Controls modulation rate with a musically tuned, non-linear curve. Syncs to host tempo or tap tempo (on Pi).
* **Depth & Position**: Shape the modulation character. Depth controls intensity; Position sets the modulation phase.
* **Offset**: Applies a time shift (pre-delay-like) to enhance groove and stereo image.
* **Feedback**: Positive or negative feedback with distinct tonal results; can self-oscillate at higher settings.
* **Color**: Alters the tonal quality of the feedback path. More pronounced at high speeds.
* **Sidechain Compressor**: Reacts to dry or external signals for rhythmic ducking effects.
* **Makeup Gain**: Compensates for dynamics changes after compression.
* **Mix**: Crossfades between dry and wet signals (insert-style).
* **Wet Mix**: Independent wet level (for use as send effect).
* **Tempo Sync**: Supports synced subdivisions (e.g., 1/4, 1/8, triplets).
* **Tap Button** *(Raspberry Pi only)*: Manually tap in tempo for live use.
* **Spread** *(VST/AU/Max for Live only)*: Introduces stereo width via modulation offset per channel.

### Summary

Flansch was built with sound design, musicality, and creative control in mind — ideal for both **studio use** and **live performance**.

## Requirements

This section outlines requirements for **building the plugin from this HISE project** and general compatibility notes for **using the compiled plugins**.

### For Building from Source (Using HISE)

*   **HISE Version:** HISE **`4.0.0+`** is required to open and compile this project.
    *   Download HISE: [https://hise.dev](https://hise.dev)
*   **Development Operating System:**
    *   Primarily developed and tested on **macOS Sonoma 14.5.1**.
    *   Compatibility with other macOS versions, Windows, or Linux for *HISE development* is not guaranteed by the author, though HISE itself is cross-platform.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   A standard HISE installation. No external libraries beyond what HISE manages are typically needed for building.
    *   To compile plugins, you will need the relevant SDKs installed (e.g., VST3 SDK, AU SDK via Xcode). HISE usually guides you through this.

### For Using Compiled Plugins/Exports

*   **Plugin Formats (if compiled from this project):**
    *   **VST3:** Requires a host DAW supporting VST3 (64-bit).
    *   **Audio Unit (AU):** Requires a host DAW supporting AU (64-bit) on macOS.
    *   **Max for Live (.amxd):** Requires Ableton Live (typically v10+) with Max for Live.
    *   **Raspberry Pi (RNBO Patch/Export):** Requires a Raspberry Pi (Model 3B+ or newer recommended) with a suitable audio interface (e.g., Pisound) and either the RNBO Runner application or a full version of Max/MSP.
*   **Operating Systems for Compiled Plugins:**
    *   **macOS:** Typically macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) or newer (64-bit).
    *   **Windows:** Typically Windows 10 or newer (64-bit).
*   **General System Recommendations for End-Users:**
    *   **CPU:** Intel Core i3 (or AMD equivalent) 4th Gen or newer.
    *   **RAM:** 4 GB minimum (8 GB+ recommended for DAW use).

*Note: The GitHub repository contains the HISE project source. Pre-compiled plugin installers for end-users (if available) may have their own specific README detailing user-focused system requirements.*

## What's Included?

This repository contains the necessary files to load the HISE project:

* **`Flansch.xml`:** The main HISE project file.
* **`Scripts/`:** Contains custom HiseScript code for the UI and parameter handling.
* **`DspNetworks/ThirdParty/`:** Contains the exported **C++ source code** generated by RNBO for the core DSP logic.
* **`Images/`:** Contains image files used in the user interface.
* **`LICENSE`:** Contains the full license texts governing this project (primarily GPLv3).
* `README.md`: This file (you are reading it).
* `UserPresets/`: Contains user presets for the plugin.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone/Download:** Get this repository onto your computer (`git clone https://github.com/voxuser1/Flansch.git` or Download ZIP).
2. **Open HISE:** Start the HISE application (Version **`4.0.0+`** or newer).
3. **Load Project:** In HISE, navigate to `File -> Open Project...` and select the `Flansch.xml` file from the downloaded repository folder.
4. **Ready!** The "Flansch" project should now be loaded in HISE for use or further development. No external samples need to be located.
5. **(Optional) Compile Plugin:** HISE typically compiles the provided C++ source code from the `DspNetworks/ThirdParty/` directory **internally** when you export the project as a plugin (`File -> Export -> Export as Instrument/Effect Plugin...`). You generally **do not need** to manually create C++ templates or pre-compile the RNBO code into a DLL yourself for use within HISE, as HISE handles the integration of the source code directly. Remember the licensing implications (GPLv3) if you distribute the compiled plugin (see below).
6. Watch how to import RNBO C++ into HISE: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64dTcwnP40o&list=PL8GPnq2Y2PthasyFljWcE04f9D2E3jfGe&index=5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64dTcwnP40o&list=PL8GPnq2Y2PthasyFljWcE04f9D2E3jfGe&index=5)

* **HISE Framework:** The HISE framework itself is licensed under GPLv3.
* **Core DSP (RNBO Export):** Originates from RNBO export functionality (Copyright © 2023 Cycling '74). It is provided here under the **GPLv3**, as permitted by Cycling '74. The corresponding C++ source code is located in the **`DspNetworks/ThirdParty/`** directory of this repository.
* **RNBO Guitar Pedals Library (Part of DSP):** Portions of the core DSP code originate from a Cycling '74 library (Copyright © 2022 Cycling '74), licensed under the **MIT License**. The MIT license text is included in the main `LICENSE` file.
* **Assets (Images):**

  * The A-Tom Soundware logo file (`Images/Logo_25.3`) is Copyright (c) 2025 A-Tom Soundware. **All Rights Reserved.** Its use is restricted, and it may not be copied, modified, or redistributed without explicit permission from A-Tom Soundware.
