# Flansch

A flanger effect plugin for audio processing, based on RNBO exports and built with HISE.

**Project Status:** Version 1.0.1

## Features

*   Core flanger DSP logic derived from RNBO export (incorporating rnbo_guitar_pedals components).
*   User interface built and scripted using HISE.
*   Controllable parameters: Speed, Depth, Position, Offset, Feedback, Color, Spread, Comp, Gain, Mix.

## Requirements

*   **HISE:** Requires HISE version **`4.0.0+`**. Download HISE: https://hise.dev
*   **Operating System:** Developed and tested primarily on **macOS Sonoma 14.5.1**. Compatibility with other macOS versions, Windows, or Linux is not guaranteed.  
    *(Note: Developed and tested on macOS 14.5.1. Compatibility with future macOS versions such as 14.6 is untested.)*

## What's Included?

This repository contains the necessary files to load the HISE project:

*   **`Flansch.xml`:** The main HISE project file.
*   **`Scripts/`:** Contains custom HiseScript code for the UI and parameter handling.
*   **`DspNetworks/ThirdParty/`:** Contains the exported **C++ source code** generated by RNBO for the core DSP logic.
*   **`Images/`:** Contains image files used in the user interface.
*   **`LICENSE`:** Contains the full license texts governing this project (primarily GPLv3).
*   `README.md`: This file (you are reading it).
*   `UserPresets/`: Contains user presets for the plugin.

## Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone/Download:** Get this repository onto your computer (`git clone https://github.com/voxuser1/Flansch.git` or Download ZIP).
2.  **Open HISE:** Start the HISE application (Version **`4.0.0+`** or newer).
3.  **Load Project:** In HISE, navigate to `File -> Open Project...` and select the `Flansch.xml` file from the downloaded repository folder.
4.  **Ready!** The "Flansch" project should now be loaded in HISE for use or further development. No external samples need to be located.
5.  **(Optional) Compile Plugin:** HISE typically compiles the provided C++ source code from the `DspNetworks/ThirdParty/` directory **internally** when you export the project as a plugin (`File -> Export -> Export as Instrument/Effect Plugin...`). You generally **do not need** to manually create C++ templates or pre-compile the RNBO code into a DLL yourself for use within HISE, as HISE handles the integration of the source code directly. Remember the licensing implications (GPLv3) if you distribute the compiled plugin (see below).

## IMPORTANT: Licensing

This project combines software components under different licenses. **Please see the `LICENSE` file for the full, detailed license texts.** Here is a summary:

*   **Primary Project License:** GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3). This applies to the HISE project file (`Flansch.xml`), the HiseScript code created by A-Tom Soundware (`Scripts/`), and the core DSP code derived from RNBO.
*   **HISE Framework:** The HISE framework itself is licensed under GPLv3.
*   **Core DSP (RNBO Export):** Originates from RNBO export functionality (Copyright © 2023 Cycling '74). It is provided here under the **GPLv3**, as permitted by Cycling '74. The corresponding C++ source code is located in the **`DspNetworks/ThirdParty/`** directory of this repository.
*   **RNBO Guitar Pedals Library (Part of DSP):** Portions of the core DSP code originate from a Cycling '74 library (Copyright © 2022 Cycling '74), licensed under the **MIT License**. The MIT license text is included in the main `LICENSE` file.
*   **Assets (Images):**
    *   The A-Tom Soundware logo file (`Images/Logo_25.3.png`) is Copyright (c) 2025 A-Tom Soundware. **All Rights Reserved.** Its use is restricted, and it may not be copied, modified, or redistributed without explicit permission from A-Tom Soundware.
     *   *(The logo is the only image asset included.)*
    *   *(No external samples or IRs are included in this repository.)*
*   **Compiled Plugins/Applications:** Due to the use of the GPLv3-licensed HISE framework and the choice of GPLv3 for the RNBO-derived code, any plugins or standalone applications compiled from this project and subsequently **distributed** (shared, sold, or given away) **must also be licensed under the GPLv3**. This obligates you to provide the complete corresponding source code — including the HISE project files, scripts, RNBO C++ code (`DspNetworks/ThirdParty/`), and any modifications — alongside the compiled binary.

**Please ensure you fully understand and comply with the terms of all applicable licenses (GPLv3, MIT, and any asset licenses), especially if you plan to modify, build upon, or distribute this project or compiled versions thereof.**
